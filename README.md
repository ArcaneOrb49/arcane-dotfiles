# Purpose of this Repo:

This repo are just my Hyprland and NixOS configs.

# How to add to a new system

As visible are these not the actual .config and .cache directories in ~
Meaning these files have to be created and using the ln programm a Symlink has to be created to the actual .config and .cache directories for the configurations to take effect.
Have fun!
